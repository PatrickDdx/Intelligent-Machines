## Who am I?

Hi, I'm Patrick — a medical student fascinated by how machine learning and artificial intelligence are reshaping healthcare.

This blog is where I document my journey — learning, experimenting, and sharing insights as I explore how data and algorithms can improve decision-making.

## Why This Blog Exists

This blog represents my commitment to **learning in public**—documenting my journey as I build hands-on projects and deepen my understanding of machine learning. Here's what drives me:

- **Bridging domains**: Exploring how machine learning can enhance medical research and clinical practice
- **Building intuition**: Working through real datasets to understand algorithms beyond theory
- **Sharing knowledge**: Helping fellow learners see practical workflows and honest reflections
- **Continuous growth**: Documenting failures and successes as part of the learning process

## What You'll Find Here

This isn't a tutorial site — it's a documentation of my learning process. Each post represents a step in my understanding of machine learning, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and interpretation.

**Current Focus Areas:** 

- Medical data analysis and prediction
- Classical machine learning algorithms
- Feature engineering and selection
- Model interpretation and validation

## My Approach

I focus on: 

- **Practical projects** with real-world datasets
- **Clear explanations** of methods and reasoning
- **Visual storytelling** through charts and analysis
- **Reproducible code** that others can learn from
- **Honest documentation** of challenges and insights
