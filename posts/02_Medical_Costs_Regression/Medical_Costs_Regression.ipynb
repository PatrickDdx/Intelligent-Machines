    "Predicting medical costs isn’t just a math problem — it’s about understanding the real price of our health choices. For insurers, these predictions guide fairer pricing and risk assessment. For individuals, they reveal how habits like smoking or maintaining a healthy BMI can shape future expenses. In a world where healthcare costs can make or break financial stability, this kind of model helps turn data into smarter, more informed decisions."

Key features include **age**, **sex**, **BMI**, **number of children**, **smoker status**, and **region**. The **target variable**, *charges*, captures each person’s annual medical cost, ranging from about $1,000 to over $60,000. Despite its small size, the dataset offers rich insights into how lifestyle and demographics drive healthcare expenses."

This demonstrates that data-driven models can effectively capture the underlying relationships between health behaviors and medical expenses, enabling more accurate cost forecasting and better-informed healthcare and policy decisions."

    "This project shows that predicting medical costs is possible — but there’s room to grow. Future work could explore more advanced models like Gradient Boosting or XGBoost to see if they capture even subtler patterns in the data. Another direction is adding richer features to improve model depth and realism. Finally, scaling this work to larger, more diverse datasets would help assess how well these findings hold up across different populations. The next steps are open — it’s up to you to take this foundation and push it further."
