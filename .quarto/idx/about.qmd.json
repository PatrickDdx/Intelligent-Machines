Here's what drives me:\n\n- **Bridging domains**: Exploring how machine learning can enhance medical research and clinical practice\n- **Building intuition**: Working through real datasets to understand algorithms beyond theory\n- **Sharing knowledge**: Helping fellow learners see practical workflows and honest reflections\n- **Continuous growth**: Documenting failures and successes as part of the learning process\n\n## What You'll Find Here\n\nThis isn't a tutorial site — it's a documentation of my learning process. Each post represents a step in my understanding of machine learning, from data preprocessing to model evaluation and interpretation.\n\n**Current Focus Areas:** \n\n- Medical data analysis and prediction\n- Classical machine learning algorithms\n- Feature engineering and selection\n- Model interpretation and validation\n\n## My Approach\n\nI focus on: \n\n- **Practical projects** with real-world datasets\n- **Clear explanations** of methods and reasoning\n- **Visual storytelling** through charts and analysis\n- **Reproducible code** that others can learn from\n- **Honest documentation** of challenges and insights\n\n## Start Here\n\n[You can start here](/posts/01_Welcome/Hello_Blog.ipynb) or explore the [Blog](/posts/)!\n<br>Have fun!\n\n## Let's Connect\n\nI'd love to connect with fellow machine learning enthusiasts, especially those interested in healthcare applications:\n\n- **LinkedIn**: [My LinkedIn Profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/patrick-linke-905b16372)\n\n- **GitHub**: [My GitHub Profile](https://github.com/PatrickDdx)\n\n---\n\n*Learning in public.
