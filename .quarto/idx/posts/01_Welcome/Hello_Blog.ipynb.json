It makes it easy to build prototypes and MVPs quickly. \nIt is also fairly easy to learn, so I encourage you to check it out if any of the topics sound interesting.\n\n**Core libraries I'll use:**\n\n- **Numpy** — fundamental package for scientific computing  \n- **Pandas** — data analysis and manipulation of tabular data  \n- **Matplotlib.pyplot** — plotting figures and creating visualizations  \n- **Seaborn** — advanced statistical plotting \n- **Scikit-Learn** — classical machine learning algorithms\n\n# Thanks for Reading This First Post!\n\nIf you’d like to know more about me and why I started this blog, check out the [About page](../../about.qmd).
